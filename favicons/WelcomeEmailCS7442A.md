Welcome to CS74.42A Game Development
 
First of all, I apologize for my absence at our first class session yesterday.

We have a lot of exciting material to cover in this course, and so I'd like to get some administrative things out of the way that I had planned for our first class.  These will count as homework for the first week.

The course web-page is now on-line:  
http://online.santarosa.edu/section/?21423

Please read over the course page, and follow the class check-in process for CATE at the bottom.

We will be using github ( http://github.com ) for assignments, so you will need an account.

There is a link on the bottom of our course page for Homework 1, use it to tell me a little about yourself and your interests in games.

We will be programming in Javascript, using HTML5 and CSS for games - if you haven't had any exposure to javascript before, there are excellent free on-line tutorials and books.

I recommend:

and

Thank you,
Tyler Bryant Ph.D.
